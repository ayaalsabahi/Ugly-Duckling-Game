RELEASE NOTES: 
Prototype Build: 
1. Integrated movement and eating mechanic
2. Must eat duck to pass through the wall
3. Following camera and larger map to come

Alpha Build: 
1. Collectibles have been started
2. NPC movement has been started
3. The team planned their schedule expecting a Wednesday so we were not able to add as much new functionality since the prototype but new scripts and scriptable objects have been started.

Beta Build: 
1. Collectibles and quests have been added along with an area unlock system to guide player progress
2. A Terrain has been added with a navmesh so that NPC can move on their own
3. The camera broke recently and we are still working to fix it
4.We still have to add in the final npc and environment assets and the last quests for a cohesive story

Final: 
1. Talk to the ducks to figure out where to go and who to eat
2. The questline has been finished but significantly reduced leading to some gaps in story
3. The game has two ends one in which you give up on finding friends and one in which you must eat 10 more ducks after completing the final quest
4. All assets have been ported to the game however there is an issue with the shades appearing on you once you eat the duck wearing shades(the hat is a good example of how it should work)
